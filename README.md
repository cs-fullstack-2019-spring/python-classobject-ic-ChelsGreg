Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 1:
Create a Dinner class with attributes dishName, protein, veggie, and price. In the class, create a function that will print all attributes. Create an object of Dinner in your problem1 function and print all of it's attributes.

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘0’. If the user doesn't enter '0', ask them to input another string.

### Problem 3:
Create an Account class with attributes: name, balance, and creationDate. The class should have an updateBalance function that can update the balance and a printNameAndBalance function that will print the name and balance of an object.

a) Create an account named "Kenn" with $50

b) Create an account named "Kevin" with $95

c) Print the Kenn account and the Kevin acccount

c) Add $15 to the Kenn account through the function

d) Remove $10 from the Kevin account

e) Print the Kenn account and the Kevin acccount


## Problem 4:
Create a ToDo class. Create the attributes: name, dueDate, list (this should be an array). Create a function that can add a string to the list. Create an object of ToDo in your problem4 function and print all of it's attributes.

### Challenge
Continue with Exercise 4, but create a method that will ask the user which item to delete and delete it.
