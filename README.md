Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 1:
Dinner Class
Create a Dinner class with attributes dishName, protein, veggie, and price. Create a function that prints each attribute. Create an object of the class in your main function.

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

### Problem 3:
Exercise 31
Create a program that creates an account with the balance of 100.0, deposits 20.0 and prints the account. Note! do all the steps described in the exercise exactly in the described order!

Exercise 32
Creates an account named "Matt's account" with the balance of 1000
Creates an account named "My account" with the balance of 0
Withdraws 100.0 from Matt's account
Deposits 100.0 to My account
Prints both accounts


## Problem 4:
Create a ToDo class. Create the attributes: name, dueDate, list (this should be an array). There should not be a method in this class. The main function below should work with the class you create.

### Challenge
Continue with Exercise 2, but create a method that will append a string variable to the list. The main function should look like this now:
